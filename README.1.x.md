# livedata-ktx
Kotlin extension for LiveData, chaining like RxJava


# Getting Started

To add LiveData KTX to your project, add the following to your app module's build.gradle:

```groovy
implementation "com.shopify:livedata-ktx:VERSION"
```

#### For `android.arch.lifecycle:livedata:1.x`, please use `com.shopify:livedata-ktx:1.x`
#### For `androidx.lifecycle:livedata:2.x`, please use `com.shopify:livedata-ktx:2.x`

*(Check https://github.com/Shopify/livedata-ktx/releases for more information)*


# Usage


### Chaining LiveData

```kotlin
val liveData: MutableLiveData<Boolean> = MutableLiveData()
liveData
  .distinct()
  .filter { it == false }
  .map { true }
  .nonNull()
  .observe(lifecycleOwner, { result ->
    // result is non-null and always true
  })
```

### Remove observer

Because the input observer goes through a wrapper before it observes to source LiveData. So that you can't simply remove it by just calling origin method `liveData.removeObserver`.

The new observe method returns `Removable` interface that allows you to remove observer effectively.

```kotlin
val liveData: MutableLiveData<Boolean> = MutableLiveData()
val removable = liveData
  .nonNull()
  .observe(lifecycleOwner, {
    // TODO
  })
removable.removeObserver()
```

### SingleLiveData

It is a lifecycle-aware observable that sends only new updates after subscription, used for events like navigation and Snackbar messages. `livedata-ktx` has different implementation comparing to SingleLiveEvent from [google samples android-architecture](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/blob/dev-todo-mvvm-live/todoapp/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/architecture/blueprints/todoapp/SingleLiveEvent.java).

```kotlin
val liveData: MutableLiveData<Int> = SingleLiveData()
val actuals: MutableList<Int?> = mutableListOf()
val observer: (t: Int?) -> Unit = { actuals.add(it) }

liveData.value = 1
liveData.observe(this, observer)
liveData.value = 2
liveData.value = 3

val expecteds = mutableListOf(2, 3)
assertEquals(expecteds, actuals)
```

For more use cases, please see the tests at [LiveDataTest.kt](https://github.com/shopify/livedata-ktx/blob/master/livedata-ktx/src/test/java/com/shopify/livedataktx/LiveDataTest.kt)
